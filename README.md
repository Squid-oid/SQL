### What is this
I've wanted to learn SQL for a long time, so this repo contains my notes, and a demo project to show that process.

The demo project shows roughly how the MVP backend of a service that allows users to upload, rate and search rock climbing walls across various gyms and locations. The primary focus is on how that database could be structured, filled and accsessed. 
The project is still a WIP but so far the database filling is mostly done, and already showcases hosting a mySQL server on my local machine, a handle on how to acsess and interface with SQL, and linking SQL into python.
